## Objectives {.unnumbered}

The aim is to develop a Spring Boot:

- using layered programming
- creating new functionalities

The principle will be the same as what was done in IT project 2A.

## Before you start

When you've finished, don't forget to delete your service.

After each part, create a commit and push your code to the remote repository.

### Launch service VSCode Java

:construction: 

2 possibilities:

- [ ] Launch VSCode-python opening port 9000
  - installjava.sh
- [ ] Create a new image ?

```
FROM vscode-python
Enable port 9000
INSTALL JAVA, MVN...
```



### Update your forked repository

As you did in TP2, you need to update your fork of the [ENSAI-2A-Java-TP](https://github.com/ludo2ne/ENSAI-2A-Java-TP){target="_blank"} repository.

- [ ] Login to [GitHub](https://github.com/){target="_blank"}
- [ ] Open the fork of ENSAI-2A-Java-TP, you created at the first practical
- [ ] Click on the button **Sync fork**


### Clone and Open Folder

In VSCode :

- [ ] Open a terminal and clone your own repo
- [ ] File > Open Folder > tp4

**tp4** must be the root folder in your explorer.


### Compile and run

Use this command to run your application:

- `mvn spring-boot:run`
- `CTRL + C` to stop

After launching the Spring Boot application, it will be deployed to something like:

- `https://user-<sspcloud_username>-<6digits_number>-user-9000.user.lab.sspcloud.fr/`


::: {.callout-warning}
If you meet that error: *Web server failed to start. Port 9000 was already in use.*

- `ps -aux | grep java`
- kill processes (ask for help!)

:::

## Exercice

You'll be working on an application that manages registrations for running races.

Features already implemented:

- List of all Athletes
- Add an Athlete
- Delete an Athlete

::: {.callout-caution}
To make it easier to use, you'll be using:

- [Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/){target="_blank"} to provide an interface
- An embedded, in-memory H2 database

However, bear in mind that in modern applications, Java is not used for GUIs. For example, the standard stack at INSEE is:

- database: PostgreSQL
- backend: Java (API that exposes endpoints)
- frontend: [React JS](https://react.dev/){target="_blank"} (uses API data for display)
:::

### Project structure

If you expand all the folders, you'll notice that there are a lot of files.

Let's focus on a few key points:

- `src/main/java/fr/ensai/running/`: the java classes of your Layered Spring Boot application
  - Layers: controller, service, repository, model...
  - `Application.java`: the Main class to run your application
- `src/main/resources/`
  - `templates/`: html pages
  - `application.yml`:  Spring Boot properties of your application
- `pom.xml`: Maven config

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="To go further"}
- `/config`: To setup your app (security...)
- `LoggerAspect.java`: Used to log before and after each method call
:::



### Workflow example

- You want to display all Athletes
- You click on button *Athletes* on the navigation bar
  - This takes you to the `/athletes` endpoint (check the *navbar.html* file if necessary)
- In the Controller, it match with method `findAllAthletes()`
  - This method calls method `findAll()` from the service
    - This method calls method `findAll()` from the repository
      - But if you check class *AthleteRepository.java*, there is no method *findAll()*
      - In fact, it's a native method of *CrudRepository*, so it is not necessary to implement it
      - This method retrieves all athletes from the database
  - Once the data has been retrieved, the method returns the string 'allAthletes'
  - Which means that you will be redirected to the *allAthletes.html* page.


  athlete

```{mermaid}
sequenceDiagram
    participant IHM
    participant AthleteController
    participant AthleteService
    participant CrudRepository

    IHM->>AthleteController: Request findAllAthletes()
    AthleteController->>AthleteService: Call findAll()
    AthleteService->>CrudRepository: Call findAll()
    CrudRepository->>CrudRepository: Execute findAll()
    CrudRepository-->>AthleteService: Return list of athletes
    AthleteService-->>AthleteController: Return list of athletes
    AthleteController-->>IHM: Return allAthletes
```

### Create competitions

::: {.callout-note}
The goal is to display all competitions.
:::

In your database there is a table called `competition`.

```{.sql}
CREATE TABLE competition (
    id_competition SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    designation    VARCHAR(255),
    city           VARCHAR(255),
    event_date     DATE,
    distance       FLOAT,
    max_athletes   INTEGER
);
```

- [ ] Create a Model class for competitions
  - To store dates, use `LocalDate` from *java.time.LocalDate*
- [ ] Create an interface *CompetitionRepository* to access the data in the database
- [ ] Write a service class for competitions with methods allowing you to:
  - list all competitions
  - find a competition from its id
  - delete a competition
- [ ] Code a controller to handle these endpoints:
  - `/competition`: display all competition (allCompetition.html)
  - `/competition/delete/{id}`: to delete a competition using its id


### Binding Athletes and Competitions

We have Athletes.

We have competitions.

Now we want to register athletes for competitions.

```{.sql}
CREATE TABLE registration (
    id_registration       SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    id_athlete            BIGINT REFERENCES athlete(id_athlete),
    id_competition        BIGINT REFERENCES competition(id_competition),
    registration_date     DATE
);
```

- [ ] Code Model class Registration
- [ ] Create Repository interface
- [ ] Include a method to find a Registration from an Athlete and a Competition

::: {.callout-tip}
You can use [Query creation from method names](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/reference/jpa/query-methods.html){target="_blank"}
:::

- [ ] Add a method *findAthleteIdByCompetitionId(Long idCompetition)* using the custom query below

```{.sql}
SELECT r.athlete.id
  FROM Registration r
 WHERE r.competition.id = :idCompetition
```

Now let's add some methods in `CompetitionService`:

- [ ] Add a method *findRegisteredAthletes(Long idCompetition)* returning the list of athletes registered for a given competition
- [ ] Create a method *deleteRegistration(Long idCompetition, Long idAthlete)*

Try to delete a Competition. What's wrong?

- [ ] Update method *CompetitionService.deleteById()*
- [ ] Bonus: you will meet the same issue if you try to delete an Athlete. Fix it


### Register an Athlete

difficulty : :star: :star: :star:

On the screen listing the athletes in a competition:

- [ ] Add a drop-down menu listing Athletes no registered in the current Competition
- [ ] Insert a button to register the selected Athlete

In Java classes:

- [ ] Create a controller method *registerAthleteCompetition(Long competitionId, Long athleteId)*
- [ ] Create a service method 
  - to create the Registration 
  - call the suitable repository method
