## Instructions

- Groups of 1 or 2 students (from the same TP group)
  - Edit the *README.md* (when it's created) file to enter your names
  - Inter-group plagiarism will be severely punished
- Due Date: **Wednesday 26 March at 10pm**
  - 1 point deducted for each half-hour delay
- Zip your project repository and load it on Moodle
  - Don't include *target* folder

Your code must be functional, with no compilation or runtime errors.

Don't forget to include the javadoc and to comment your code if necessary.

::: {.callout-important}
- Everything you need is in the course and the practical exercises 
- You are permitted to conduct internet searches to find information and documentation
- The use of any LLM is [strictly prohibited]{.underline} during this exam
  - As Olivier so rightly says: LLMs are good servants, but bad masters
  - They can be useful tools, but they must not replace your own comprehension and programming skills

If you are caught using an LLM, it will be considered cheating and you will receive a zero.
